# API-Weathermap
I do not know why but after you type in the city you have to hit the button with the city name to get the 5 day forecast to generate the correct date. I have been through several itterations and can't figure out why. I even had my brother work on it with me to no resolution. 
I believe that all of the elements are present and that I was able to add a little bit of style withe the background images. Getting the javascript to render the dates correctly took a lot of time and research to figure out how to get it to work.
